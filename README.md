CSCI-2467 Lab 11 – Refactor LinkedList Application to use Generics
Background
Look at the linked articles and video to learn about linked lists.
Assignment
Download the Lab11.zip starter file. Use 7zip to unzip the file using ‘Extract Here’. Open the project folder in IntelliJ. 
The code consists of three files that implement and use a simple linked list. The code was written in early Java style using the Object class in order to allow the linked list to be a list of objects of any type. While the code works, it is not type safe. Refactor the code to use Java Generics. You will need to change the Main class to create a linked list of Strings in the list1() method and a linked list of Integers in the list2() method.
You’ll then need to make appropriate modifications to the other two Java files so that they use Java Generics.
Do NOT use the built-in Java LinkedList class.
Additional Information
After you have completed and thoroughly tested your changes, zip the entire project and submit the zipped project file via Blackboard.
